/**
 * Domain layer - Core business entities and value objects.
 *
 * This package contains:
 * - Entities: Objects with identity that persist over time
 * - Value Objects: Immutable objects defined by their attributes
 * - Aggregates: Clusters of domain objects treated as a single unit
 *
 * Rules:
 * - ZERO framework dependencies
 * - Pure Java/business logic only
 * - All dependencies point inward (nothing depends on outer layers)
