/**
 * Use cases - Application service implementations orchestrating domain logic.

 * Use cases:
 * - Implement input port interfaces
 * - Orchestrate domain objects and services
 * - Call output ports for persistence/external services
 * - Handle transactions (via framework annotations where needed)
 *
 * They contain NO business logic - that belongs in the domain layer.
